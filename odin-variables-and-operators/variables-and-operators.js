// VARIABLES: two ways to declare

let age = 11;       // re-assignable.
console.log(age);   // outputs 11 to the console

age = 54;           // re-assign value

console.log(age);   // what will be the output now?


const pi = 3.14;    // not re-assignable.
pi = 10;            // hmmm...

console.log(pi);    // error is thrown

// <var> was a third way but is not really used anymore.
